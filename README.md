# Age-engine
Welcome to the read-me of the Age-engine

## Features:
### [Window](https://github.com/Pegacraft/Age-engine/wiki/Display-class) handling
The ability to create windows without the need to do all of the JFrame stuff.

### [Scene](https://github.com/Pegacraft/Age-engine/wiki/Scene-class) handling
The ability to split your program into different scenes. For a better project structure and performance.

### [Entity](https://github.com/Pegacraft/Age-engine/wiki/Entity-interface) handling
Ability to create objects that ar looped and rendered by the engine.

### Simple UI components
The whole engine is based on one canvas component on the window. becourse you cant use the normal swing components, we added new simple UI comonents like:

- Buttons
- TextBoxes
- TickBoxes
- Bossbars

### Simpler key and mouse listener
The ability to interact with the [keyboard](https://github.com/Pegacraft/Age-engine/wiki/Keyboard-listener) and the [mouse](https://github.com/Pegacraft/Age-engine/wiki/Mouse-listener) without the need of the complicated build in listeners in java.

### Hit detection
Simple [hitboxes](https://github.com/Pegacraft/Age-engine/wiki/Hitbox-class) to check if objects colide or if a point is inside another.
